## A Neat Lemmy Webapp

Note: Highly Work in Progress!

Follow the development on the [Nemmy Community on Lemmy](https://lemmy.world/c/nemmy)

#### TL;DR
Nemmy is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for Lemmy. Lemmy is kinda like Reddit, but federated so a CEO can't just fuck over everyone.
The goal of Nemmy is to make using Lemmy on multiple devices a seamless experience.

#### Why Nemmy?
There are other good Apps for Lemmy out there, even other PWAs like [wefwef.app](wwefwef.app).
What singles out Nemmy is not focusing on a single devices (e.g. Mobile-First design) but making the user experience equally good on most devices.

### Roadmap
Currently, I'm working on implementing basic features (e.g. Login, Voting, Creating Posts, Comments).

Here are some other features that I will implement soon:
- Theming
- Customization (e.g. Post-Style, Font-Size)
- Offline Support (as far as practiable, Lemmy is social media after all)

#### Tech-Stack
- Next.js
- Lemmy Js Client
- Material-Icons
- Tailwind
