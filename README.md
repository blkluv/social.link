<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Nemmy is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for Lemmy. Lemmy is kinda like Reddit, but federated so a CEO can't just fuck over everyone. 
The goal of Nemmy is to make using Lemmy on multiple devices a seamless experience.

Right now Nemmy is in very early Development, however, feel free to visit the Website once in a while to see what's changed.

If you like the idea of Nemmy, this is the perfect opportunity for you to influence design decisions by submitting Feedback or Feature requests. You can do that on here in the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/Cr4yfish/Nemmy/issues) or the [Nemmy Community on Lemmy](https://lemmy.world/c/nemmy).

##### Why Nemmy?
There are other good Apps for Lemmy out there, even other PWAs like [wefwef.app](wwefwef.app).
What singles out Nemmy is not focusing on a single devices (e.g. Mobile-First design) but making the user experience equally good on most devices.

#### What's Lemmy?
The short version is, that Lemmy is similar to Reddit. The main difference is that Lemmy is Open-Source and Federated.
This means that there is no single huge "Lemmy Server" but many smaller "instances" of Lemmy hosted by different people. These instances can communicate with each other, so you can follow people on other instances and see their posts and comments.
